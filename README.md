# InfinitESP
ESP32 implementation of Carrier thermostat RS485 "ABCD bus"

Placeholder for an [esp32-box-lite](https://amzn.to/3PqKc7E) firmware implementation of Carrier's serial RS485 protocol to automate Infinity Touch thermostats.

### Goals are (roughly in priority order):

1. Parse incoming RS485 state
2. Control state (current setpoints & schedule) via serial writes, similar to what the [Infinitive](https://github.com/acd/infinitive) project does for legacy stats
3. Provide basic LCD thermostat interface
probably based on the [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl) thermostat example

4. Implement a Home Assistant standard Climate device.
   * Either as an MQTT climate device 
   * or a custom climate device. 
   * Ideally as an [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) integration
6. OpenSCAD / STL file to contain necessary RS485 module.
7. Autoconfigure wifi since the thermostat freely gives out wifi credentials ðŸ¤¯
8. Provide web interface
9. Play nicely with [Infinitude](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl)
   * Act as serial/tcp bridge
   * Serve as NAT gateway
1. ESP Rainmaker app/cloud interface
