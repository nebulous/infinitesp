ESP32 implementation of Carrier thermostat RS485 "ABCD bus"

Placeholder for an [esp32-box-lite](https://amzn.to/3PqKc7E) firmware implementation of Carrier's serial RS485 protocol.

Goals are:

1. autoconfigure wifi since the thermostat freely gives out wifi credentials ðŸ¤¯
2. control current temperature and schedule via serial writes, similar to what the Infinitive project does for legacy stats
3. Provide basic LCD thermostat interface
4. Implement a standard Climate device which can be used by Home Assistant. Either as an MQTT climate device or a custom climate device.
5. OpenSCAD / STL file to contain necessary RS485 module.
